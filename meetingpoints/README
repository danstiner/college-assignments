Finding Meeting Points

Simple programming exercise to find the possible meeting nodes for two people on a directed graph.

Meeting nodes are found in O(n*m) time, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of starting nodes. Memory required is O(n)

Note that the second person will traverse the directed graph in reverse from the normal, expeced direction the first person will traverse it.

Output will be the names of possible meeting nodes, one per line on STDOUT.
Input is assumed to be on STDIN of the form:

Map:
<fromNodeName1> <toNodeName1>
<fromNodeName2> <toNodeName2>
<fromNodeName3> <toNodeName3>
...
Avoid:
<NodeNameToAvoid1> <NodeNameToAvoid2> ...
First Person:
<StartNodeName1> <StartNodeName2> ...
Second Person:
<StartNodeName1> <StartNodeName2> ...
