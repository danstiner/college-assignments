OVERVIEW

Efficient implementation of minimum tree finding using Prim's and Kurskal's
algorithms.


INSTALLATION

Requires boost version 1.38ish or higher for unordered_map.

Either use 'make' under linux or import the project to eclipse and build.
Run configurations are setup in eclipse for both prims and kruskals executables.


USAGE

./kruskals graph_input_file mst_output_file

Where the input file is of the form:
  <number of unique vertices>
  <number of edges>
  <vertex> <vertex> <weight>
  <vertex> <vertex> <weight>
  ...

and the output minimum spanning tree file will be of the same form
